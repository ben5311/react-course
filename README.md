# React - The Complete Guide 2024 Course Resources

This repository is forked from <https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-course-resources> and provides code files, slides, and other resources of the [Udemy React course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

React is a JavaScript library to build web and native user interfaces.

It uses a declarative programming style: You define the target UI state, but not the steps to get there. Instead, React will figure out how to achieve the target state.

## Repository Content

- **Code Snapshots:** All code snapshots (starting snapshots, intermediate snapshots, finished snapshots) for the various course sections can be found in the [/code](/code/) folder.
- **Lecture Attachments:** Any standalone code files or other attachments that are mentioned in course lectures (and attached to those lectures) are stored in the [/attachments](/attachments/) folder.
- **Other Resources:** Other resources (like the course slides) can be found in the [/other](/other/) folder.

The **Code Snapshots** and **Lecture Attachments** folders contain one subfolder per course section - this allows you to easily access the resources for a specific course section.

## How To Use Code Snapshots

If you want to run the code snapshots on your machine, you'll need to run `npm install` in the individual snapshot folders, followed by `npm run dev` to start the development server - just as shown in the course.
